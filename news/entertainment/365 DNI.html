                        <p>  If there's one thing everyone involved in the film 365 Days wants you remember, it's this: Nothing happening onscreen is real.   </p>
                        
                        <p> Since its arrival to Netflix in June, the racy Polish film has left viewers breathless thanks to its boundary-pushing sex scenes and controversial central romance. And we're talking a lot of viewers. It's become the first movie on the streaming service to have two multi-day periods as the No. 1 film in the U.S. since the chart was introduced in February with virtually zero promotion and, well, less-than-stellar reviews. Not only that, but it's made it into the top three most-viewed projects in 26 other countries.  </p>

                        

                        <p>Clearly, its tapped into something that quarantined audiences have been craving, whether they even knew it or not.</p>
                        <p>Earning it comparisons to 50 Shades of Grey for more than just its soft-core porn approach, 365 Days is based on the first book in a trilogy written by Blanka Lipińska. The film tells the story of Laura Biel, a Polish woman kidnapped by Sicilian mafia Don Massimo Torricelli and given a year to fall in love with him before he'll set her free. It also frequently features its stars Anna-Maria Sieklucka and Michele Morrone naked, engaged in sex scenes with chemistry so real it's hard to distinguish if they're even acting.</p>
                        <p>"I wrote that book for myself, with no intention of showing it to the world. But I know myself and I know that sometimes I change my decisions on a whim. So when I thought about it, I was sure I'd be able to cobble up a screen adaptation," Lipińska, who also co-wrote the screenplay, told E! News via e-mail. "I could visualise each scene in my head. Is there any other way to write a book, by the way? You have to describe images with words. Are there scenes in the movie as racy as I imagined them? No, but censorship didn't allow me to do everything I wanted. Still, I think they're the best sex scenes I've seen in commercial cinematography to date."</p>
                        <p>It's those very scenes that have turned the film's stars into internet sensations practically overnight. 365 Days was originally released in Poland in February, where its success was nothing compared to the global frenzy it would generate once it landed on Netflix. Neither Sieklucka nor Morrone seem especially fazed by the attention being paid to their impossibly beautiful bodies. </p>

                        <p>As the Italian actor and father of two, who'd all but given up on the craft when the role of Massimo came his way, said, "It makes me feel good because maybe it means I am a good actor." 

                            Via e-mail, his co-star concurred. "It means that we are great actors," Sieklucka said, "because most people think that everything was really happening."
                            
                            Though Morrone admitted that, in the beginning, filming the erotic moments was "kind of weird" because he and Sieklucka had just become "such good friends," they eventually had fun with it. "For me, it wasn't hard to do that because, as an actor, I always wanted to be real in everything I do. So normal sex scene, I just want it to be real because I want to have done my work in the most pure way ever."</p>
                        <p>While the two actors grapple with what's next for them, the author who created their breakthrough roles contends that her triumphs were never in doubt. "I planned the whole thing from the get go, both for the movie and the book, so I can't say that success came as a surprise," Lipińska said. "Don't get me wrong—I'm not being cocky. I simply knew how good and unique that story was. There aren't many erotic films with genuinely good sex scenes and such a good-looking main actor. Success was just a matter of time."</p>
